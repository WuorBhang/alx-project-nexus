# ProDev Backend Engineering Program

## Overview

The ProDev Backend Engineering program is a comprehensive initiative aimed at developing skilled backend engineers capable of building scalable, efficient, and secure server-side applications. Participants dive into modern backend technologies and practices, focusing on real-world projects like the Online Poll System to apply learned concepts. The program emphasizes collaboration, best practices, and problem-solving in a team environment, preparing learners for professional development roles.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered

- **Python**: Core programming language for backend logic and scripting.
- **Django**: High-level web framework for building robust applications quickly.
- **REST APIs**: Designing stateless, scalable web services for data exchange.
- **GraphQL**: Advanced API querying for flexible data retrieval.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD**: Automation pipelines for continuous integration, testing, and deployment.

### Important Backend Development Concepts

- **Database Design**: Structuring relational and non-relational databases for optimal performance, normalization, and scalability.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Using async/await patterns to handle concurrent operations, improving responsiveness in I/O-bound tasks.
- **Caching Strategies**: Implementing in-memory caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce database hits and enhance application speed.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented

Throughout the program, challenges included handling real-time data processing for voting systems to prevent delays, ensuring secure user verification to avoid fraud, and optimizing queries for high-traffic scenarios. Solutions involved designing efficient PostgreSQL schemas with indexes for fast vote counting, integrating national ID validation via external APIs for automated user verification, and applying asynchronous tasks with Celery for background processing. Duplicate voting was mitigated through unique constraints and session-based checks.

### Best Practices and Personal Takeaways

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for clean, readable Python code.
- Use modular architecture, version control with meaningful commits, and comprehensive testing (unit and integration).
- Prioritize security (e.g., input validation, authentication tokens) and documentation for maintainability.
- Personal takeaways: The value of iterative development, the impact of caching on performance, and the importance of cross-team collaboration—especially with frontend developers—to ensure seamless API integration. Collaboration fosters innovation and faster problem resolution.

## Project: Building a Backend for an Online Poll System

### Real-World Application

This project simulates backend development for applications requiring real-time data processing. Developers gain experience with building scalable APIs for real-time voting systems, optimizing database schemas for frequent operations, and documenting/deploying APIs for public access.

### Overview

This case study focuses on creating a backend for an online poll system. The backend provides APIs for poll creation, voting, and real-time result computation. The project emphasizes efficient database design and detailed API documentation. To support full-stack functionality, the system includes user registration and national ID-based verification, where users input their ID, and the app fetches details (e.g., name) from government data sources via secure API integration for authentication before allowing votes.

### Project Goals

The primary objectives of the poll system backend are:

- **API Development**: Build APIs for creating polls, user registration, voting, and fetching results.
- **Database Efficiency**: Design schemas optimized for real-time result computation and secure user data storage.
- **Documentation**: Provide detailed API documentation using Swagger.

### Technologies Used

- **Django**: High-level Python framework for rapid development.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for poll, vote, and user storage.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation.

### Key Features

1. **Poll Management**

   - APIs to create polls with multiple options (admin-only for candidate registration).
   - Include metadata such as creation date, expiry, and poll status.

2. **User Registration and Authentication**

   - User signup/login endpoints.
   - National ID input for verification: Automatically fetch and validate user details (e.g., name) from government databases via integrated API.
   - Secure token-based authentication to enable voting.

3. **Voting System**

   - APIs for authenticated users to cast votes for registered candidates.
   - Implement validations to prevent duplicate voting using national ID uniqueness.

4. **Result Computation**

   - Real-time calculation of vote counts for each option/candidate.
   - Efficient query design for scalability, with caching for frequent access.

5. **API Documentation**

   - Use Swagger to document all endpoints, including authentication flows.
   - Host documentation at `/api/docs` for easy access.

### Implementation Process

#### Git Commit Workflow

- **Initial Setup**: feat: set up Django project with PostgreSQL
- **Feature Development**:
  - feat: implement user registration and national ID verification APIs
  - feat: implement poll creation (admin) and voting APIs
  - feat: add results computation API with real-time updates
- **Optimization**:
  - perf: optimize vote counting queries and add caching
- **Documentation**:
  - feat: integrate Swagger documentation
  - docs: update README with API usage, setup instructions, and examples

### Submission Details

- **Deployment**: Host the API and Swagger documentation on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku or AWS) for public access.

### Evaluation Criteria

1. **Functionality**

   - Polls, candidates, and options are created and stored accurately.
   - User registration with national ID verification works seamlessly.
   - Voting functions without duplication errors or unauthorized access.

2. **Code Quality**

   - PostgreSQL models are efficient, normalized, and secure.

3. **Performance**

   - Vote counting queries are optimized for scalability.
   - Real-time results are computed efficiently with caching.

4. **Documentation**

   - Swagger documentation is detailed and accessible.
   - README includes setup instructions, API usage examples, and collaboration notes.
